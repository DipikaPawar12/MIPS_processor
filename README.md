# MIPS_processor
---

- This processor in a 16 bit processor with some sepcific features and some specific blocks.
 ---
 ```
  - Execution Block
  - Program Memory Block
  - Instruction Memory Block
  - Register Bank Block
  - Data Memory Block
  - Stall Control Block
  - Write Back Block
  - Jump Control Block
  - Dependency Check Block
  ```

 - Booth Algo
 ---
  ```
   - The main aim of including the feature of booth algorithm is that it performs the multiplication fast.The number of steps required for the product calculation of two numbers      are reduced significantly.
   - The reduction in the number of steps reduces the complexity thereby reducing the time for performing the multiplication algorithm.
   - It can be used for both positive and negative integers.
   - We have also tried to implement the cordic algorithm which is used for computation of trigonometric functions.
   - This algorithm uses simple add-shift operation with less complexity.
